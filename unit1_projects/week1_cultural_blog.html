    		<h2><center>Exploring Your Values</center></h2>

    		<p class = "blog_body"> Adventure, Challenge, Commitment, Integrity, Knowledge, Nature, Self-reliance</br></br>

        Integrity: I think integrity is one of the most important values to a person.  If someone has a high integrity, there are no limits to their success.  They will be trusted and respected purely by that reputation alone.</br></br>

        A person with a poor integrity however will experience the exact opposite however.  No matter what they do, how articulate they are, or how proficient in their area, if you can't trust someone to make the right decision, they will always be pushed to the side for someone more reliable.  As working in management for the past 7 years, not only is the way I promoted through the ranks, but time and time again, this principle was shown to be the most crucial for a valuable employee.  This not only reflects in the workplace, but in your social/family life as well.  Morality wills always be one of the most important traits to me.</br></br>

        In general, I try to live up to these values:</br></br>

        Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- 5 Agree</br></br>

        Adventure - 4 </br>
        Challenge - 3 </br>
        Commitment - 5 </br>
        Integrity - 5 </br>
        Knowledge - 5 </br>
        Nature - 3 </br>
        Self-reliance - 5 </br>

        What was the last topic that someone asked for your advice on? </br></br>

        The last topic that someone asked my advice on was a friend debating on taking a new job with a questionable law firm.  We discussed the benefits or the change, but also the new challeneges that he would be facing if he worked there.  He ended up taking the job, and is happy so far!
