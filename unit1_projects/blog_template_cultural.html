      <h2><center>The Fear of Feedback</center></h2>

      <p class = "blog_body"> We are all social creatures who thrive off the community.  Whether you love it or hate it, the impressions that you make on others is emotionally important to everyone.  Even those who claim not to care what others think for them, they wouldn't make that statement otherwise.  The problem that I have always had is a fear of hurting someone else's feelings.  I don't like to critize people, ever. </br></br>

      I dread witnessing someone hurt by something that I have said or done, it's just a part of who I am.  So the hardest part of giving feedback for me is to do it in such a way that there is no possible way it could be taken in a poor light.  Feedback is great when it's not negative!  I love getting it, I love trying to better myself to become more useful to those around me, and wish that I got more than I already do.  I am constantly asking family members and friends on their opinions on things that I am about to do or am doing.  It drives them crazy, and leads them to believe that I can't make up my mind, but at the end of the day, what I am really looking for is just their feedback!  </br></br>

      Meaningful positive feedback does not need to come as a back slapping atta boy comment.  To me, that's kinda trivial.  It's really easy to point out someone's strengths and celebrate them.  I do that all the time!  What's really hard is finding their weaknesses and bringing them out in the open in a non-threatening constructive way so that the individual can take the information and grow from it.  Whether they are not the best of listeners, are not empathetic, or have a superiority complex, you can bring those out without saying something like "You suck at listening and just do what you want" or "Chuck didn't care what was going on around him or how I was feeling, he just wanted to get through the exercise."  That's not really helping at all.  Instead, list specific examples like "When we started the session, I told you that I wasn't very experienced with what I was doing, but you really wanted to drive anyways. In the future, try to share your expertise and start off by navigating!"  </br></br>

      In addition, I think a lot of the pairing process is a two way street and we need to be open to the feedback being given to us.  We have to realize that those giving us feedback are most likely just as insecure and new to this as we are ourselves.  They don't mean harm, this isn't personal, they are really trying to help us improve!  That is probably the biggest thing I will keep in mind when I pair, it's going to be tough on both ends, but all we can do is learn from it.  And if I do happen to insult you, please know it wasn't on purpose! Let me know so that we can go grab a beer and chat about it.  </br></br>
