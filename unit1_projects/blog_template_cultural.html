    		<h2><center>Stereotype Threat</center></h2>

    		<p class = "blog_body">  Unfortunately, stereotypes are alive and well in culture.  In every aspect of our day to day lives, we are either going to feel a stereotype being applied towards us, or we will turn a critical eye on others.  Rascism, sexism, ageism; they still exist, and while they may not rear their ugly heads in a public setting like they have in the past, ism's have become a much more private matter.  For example, my previous job consisted of helping those with low income to deal with their problems and debts that were owed.  I had been doing this for roughly 6 years.  It had gotten to the point, where I had developed a stereotype about potential clients.  Everytime I met with someone new, my assumption was that they were lying to me about something.  I don't know if they could feel it when talking to me, but it was always in the back of my head and my questions to them were slightly geared to getting them to give me different ansers to the same questions.  It had nothing to do with anything beyond the fact that they were consulting with me for help, and I automatically fell into a routine of trying to figure out where the lie was.  I still feel horrible about it, but after being lied to time after time again, your mind starts to associate things together.  This doesn't only harm my clients, who may or may not have lied to me, but it also harms my performance in my job.  If I can't fully believe my client, how can I advocate for them?  What I had really needed was a break.  I needed to step away from that aspect of the job to reset my worldview.</br></br>

        I think one of the problems with the ism's is that they have become a much more private matter these days.  It's normally a conflit between 2 individuals instead of large groups, and the person who is feeling threatened is likely to stay quiet about the experience rather then to speak up.  Without speaking up, change can't occur.  I don't care what some study says, you aren't smarter becuase you are of a certain race or gender, and if you are feeling like you are being told that by something or someone you are around everyday, you will never succeed or excel in what you are doing.  That's a crime against yourself!  Speak up!  The threatened individual cannot be the only responsible party however.  Leaders, management, supervisors, teachers, parents, friends and family all need to not ignore what is going around them as well.  Society needs to be a safe place for everyone to exist without predefined limitations.
