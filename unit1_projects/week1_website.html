    <h1>Comparing Website Designs</h1>
    <p>Below are three websites that I have always enjoyed.</p>
    
    <h2>Engadget.com</h2>
    <a href="http://www.engadget.com/"><center><img src ="http://img.engadget.com/common/images/4967531329796275.JPG?0.030353905118610247"></center></a>
    <p>Engadget.com - Very nice technology blog that I have been reading for years.  It covers everything from hardware reviews to science news.  It broadcasts live blogging for major tech events and releases, and is constantly updating with new stories. The site itself is very neat and clean, with a simple menu bar up top. Below that are the news entries listed by that most recent.  Each page also begins with a montage of new stories that have been deemed most important/popular.  Videos and images are provided, and the site itself is very easy to navigate.  It is also customizable so that you can focus on the topics that you enjoy.  The only thing I would change about this website was to add more writers to provide more information!<p>

 	<h2>IMDB.com</h2>
    <a href="http://www.imdb.com/"><center><img src ="http://mangusmovie.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/imdb-logo.jpeg"></center></a>

	<p>IMDB.com - Back when I had no children and actually had time to watch movies, IMDB was essential to life.  I was constantly on this website searching movies, actors and actresses.  Everytime I would find a new actor I liked, I used IMDB to find all the other movies that he/she was associated with and would add them to the netflix list.  Over the years the websites look has changed some, it used to be much less flashier, but the functionality that drew me to the page to begin with is still there.  There is a big search bar at the top that invites the user to start searching right away.  The homepage is a bit cluttered with advertisements for new movies that are coming out, box office figures, news, triva, and much much more.  This annoyed me quite a bit when the site was first redesigned, but I am now used to it and tend to ignore it for the most part.</p>

	<h2>thinkgeek.com</h2>
    <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/"><center><img src ="http://www.userlogos.org/files/logos/PaparazziPulse/Think%20Geek%20(Logo%20With%20Text).png"></center></a>

	<p>thinkgeek.com - This has always been fun diversion site to look 	through as a break.  It sells "geek" related products, most of which you would have trouble finding in other places.  The products themselves make excellent gifts and I have purchased from the site many times.  The navigation around the page is fairly straight forward, You can shop by interest or catagory, see best sellers, or what's new to the page all together.  The homepage opens to current deals and specials being offered to give you ideas if you are not looking for something specific.  All in all, a fun little site that I will continue to look at for years to come.  I will someday own a USB Rocket Launcher... it will be mine.</p>
