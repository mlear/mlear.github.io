      <h2><center>DBC R' Us</center></h2>

      <p class = "blog_body"> So I just finished watching the Fireside Chat.  At first glance, I had no idea what this video entailed, and saw that it was for an hour, and thought, "Wow.. an hour?  Really??"  Foot.  In.  Mouth.  I wish that video had been 2 hours, or 3.  I could listen to Shereef expound all day if needed.  His thoughts and insights are that valuable to me at this point in my life.   So, here's my take on the DBC experience so far.  These blogs have been the toughest thing for me throughout Phase 0.  I'm naturally a listener and not a talker.  It drives my wife absolutely bonkers.  I don't like attention being drawn to me, and prefer to give help rather than solicit it.  Then, all of the sudden, I am asked to write about who I am, and my thoughts/feelings.  On top of that, I need to make these things available to the general public?   Not easy. </br></br>


      I will admit, I am terrified right now of June 2, 2014.  I think that is partially due to my own personal fear of the unknown, I hate walking into something without knowing 100% what to expect and how to act, but it's also a product of the imposter syndrome.  I feel like I don't deserve to be attending DBC, that I don't know enough, that I will never know enough, and that I will be one of those who are asked to leave.  Then I take a breath and tell myself to shut up.  I have been working full time during phase 0 as I am still in need of a steady paycheck.  This takes up about 60-70 hours a week of my time, and on top of that, I am trying to learn as much as possible though the prep.  It's been really challenging for me to balance my old life and responsibilities to my clients and my firm, and this intense drive to just code all day!  I think what recently spooked me was this last two weeks of review.  I jumped first into the ruby exercises and found no trouble with completing them.  I then took a shot at the JavaScript and proceeded to stare at the computer for 2 hours frantically trying to remember the syntax, and how to loop, and how to loop in nested objects and so on and so on.  I really hope that I was not the only one to experience this, but with no coding practice in the past 10 years, and then having all of this thrown at me at once, I am clearly not retaining everything.  When we did the JS prep week, I was fine with it.  The instructions were clear and concise, I was handling the syntax well, and everything clicked.  Now, when I did the first review exercise, I found myself going back to that week's work and wondering how the hell I knew how to do those things!  It's a bit disconcerting, and I hope it's just part of the process.  Watching the Fireside Chat certainly helped reinforce that everything is ok, that what I am feeling is normal and just to keep on chugging along, but there is still that fear lurking in the background that I am not good enough to do this.  I will prove myself wrong.  I'm going to work my butt off for the next 10 weeks to be the best damn programmer that I can be, and not just for myself and family, but for Shereef as well.  I will always remember his analagy of learning to program is like learning an instrument.  Don't expect to compose a song just becuase someone showed you some chords and gave you some sheet music to review.  It's a process that requires practice, practice and more practice.  Eventually the motions will become second nature and you can focus on the real meat of what you want to do.</br></br>

      When I went to college, I wanted to work with computers.  They were my passion, and I wanted to make that my career.  So I majored in computer engineering.  This was not a good choice.  Theortical math and I did not get along very well.  At all.  I hated it and burnt out immediately.  But instead of taking a step back to reevaulate my situation, I chugged ahead thinking, "What else can I do?".  My love was problem solving, hence engineering.  I loved to be given a question that needed to be figured out.  Now that I was burnt out on engineering, my next best option, or so I though, was law.  HUGE mistake.  I should have realized that I didn't want to be dealing with complex electronic's.  That's not what I had ever wanted to do.  I wanted to code! I wanted to write programs and do stuff with computers that no one had ever dreamed about!  I still kick myself to this day for that decision, and I was constantly thinking about it until I stumbled upon DevBootCamp.</br></br>

      After listening to Shereff, I cannot wait to walk into DBC and get schooled in every aspect of my life.  I've been given a fantastic oppertunity here and I am going to ride it until I drop.  This is who I am and who I was meant to be.  Beware any who tries to stop me.
