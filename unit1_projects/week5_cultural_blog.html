      <h2><center>Net Neutrality</center></h2>

      <p class = "blog_body"> A huge problem facing the technical community currently is the issue of net neutrality.  If you have never heard of it, please do more research beyond reading this blog!  Issues that are now before the FCC and being discussed could ultimately effect everyone in the world. </br></br>
        
      Net neutrality refers to the idea of keeping the internet neutral.  That there will be no discrimination based off of content that web site may have, or a web browser that is being used, or a user in general.  As it stands, the internet is open to all who have access and is composed of the content that people put out there.  Some is public, some is private, but there are no limitations on what can be there.  You don?t have to pay extra money for more bandwidth, and there is no hard cap on the amount of data you can transfer.  If certain people get there way though, all of these things will exist and pay per click will take on a new meaning.  Want to watch HULU?  Well, first you have to pay HULU to get you access.  Then you have to pay your internet provider to provide you with enough bandwidth to stream properly.  Then you  have  to pay your provider for the extra data that you will need to be able to transfer.  Then you?ll be taxed on it on every bit that is transferred.  You don?t have to be a computer science major to realize how BAD of an idea that is.  The Internet is a wonderful place where information is shared.  Why would we limit information to only those who could afford it?  Years ago, the Chicago Tribune attempted to require that you have an account with them before you could read any of their articles online.  The result?  I haven?t been back to that website since, even though they no longer require this.  </br></br>
        
      This also affects us as programmers.  As young startups, we are technically at the same level as an Amazon, or a Google.  Anyone with a good idea could become the next HULU or ebay.   But, if we went to a closed internet, the big boys could effectively make it so expensive to do anything, that it stifles any and all competition.  Say congress allowed for a tiered internet system, but only those companies that paid the most got access to the fastest speeds?  How would anyone be able to compete in that system?  It would be horrible. </br></br>
        
      What can you do?  I?m glad you asked, SPEAK UP!  The FCC is currently seeking comments on the issue at <a href=www.fcc.gov/comments>Click Me!</a>.  Click on the proceeding # 14-28 and give the government a piece of your mind!
