        <p class = "blog_body">What is Rails?</br></br>

        Rails is a shortened name for Ruby on Rails, and it is a very popular open source web application framework for Ruby.  This blog post will give a brief introduction to Rails, but will certainly not do it the justice that is needed.  I am currently finishing up my job and preparing to start Phase 1, and if I had more time, I would write a whole lot more on the subject.</br></br>

        How does Rails work?  What is a web application framework? </br></br>

        Rails is basically a collection or library of code that works with Ruby to provide a framework for building websites.  One of the reasons Ruby is so popular is that it includes things called "gems".  These gems are provided by the developers of Rails and also the open source community that uses the languages to develop their projects.  Each gem is a collection of code that will make life as a programmer easier for whatever purpose the gem was developed for in the first place, such as <a href="http://rspec.info/">rspec</a> as an example.  Rails itself is gem.  It allows for the organization of different elements of a website, such as javascript files, stylesheets, and images.   These elements are used by Rails in conjunction with Ruby, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to build a web application.  This web application uses the different pieces fed into it to generate HTML dynamically.  This allows for faster development, easier debugging, and the ability to use predefined packages to add to your application without having to recode the entire thing.  This content is organized through the model-view-controller (MVC) pattern.  The model portion handles the manipulation of the data and access to the database.  View compiles the information to be displayed.  Controller tells the model what to do. </br></br>

        Why is Rails so popular?  </br></br>

        Due to the open source gems, and ease of coding in Ruby, development is much faster complex projects.  Ruby emphasizes Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) and "convention over configuration" principles.  In keeping a program DRY, you never want to have to write the same code twice.  This is strived for when using the object-oriented classes of Ruby.  You are also relying on defaults that you have never set in the first place, a "magic" that happens behind the scenes.  Not having to mess with configuration files, what names to use, and where to put things results in a much high productivity.  </br></br>

        All Rails applications are organized in a specific structure in conjunction with the MVC.  This allows anyone with knowledge of Rails to be able to review a Rails application and know where everything is that is supposed to be there, and how each item interacts with others.  Collaboration is much simpler this way as a complete stranger looking at your code will already be able to navigate it.  This combined with the extensive use of github for rails developers and the availability of gems is where all of the popularity arises from.</br></br>

        These are some of the basics of Rails and there is much much more available out there from wikipedia to github blogs.</p>
