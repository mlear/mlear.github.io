    	<h2><center>Exploring Your Values</center></h2>

    	<p class = "blog_body"> Learning about stereotype threat was an eye opener for me.  Before learning more about the subject, I had no idea the depth of what the topic entails.  My assumption was that stereotype threat was with regards to the way someone was treated based off of a stereotype.  Learning of the studies done that show how the subconscious mind is affected negatively was shocking, and this information should be made more public.  More people need to be aware of this problem and need to actively work against it.  In my week 1 cultural post, I talked slightly about integrity and how important it was to me in my everyday life.  I also saw it as a trait that employers look for in valued employees.  There were values that I had listed as well as integrity that I viewed as important, and still do.  I think if people stay true to their values, they can use them as shields against these threats.  Affirming your values makes you a better person, it strengthens you.  It is when you are scared, and begin to doubt yourself when the fear of failure starts to creep in.  By believing in yourself and sticking to what you feel is right, what you believe in and what you treasure, you won?t ever get to worrying about failure as you will be incapable of failing.
