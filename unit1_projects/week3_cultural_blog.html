    		<h2><center>The Pressure of Pairing</center></h2>

    		<p class = "blog_body">This weeks guided pairing session was the second time I had paired with another to work on code.  I wish I could do it for every exercise.  At first I was really nervous to start the exercise.  My first guided pairing session was just with myself and Jacky as my work schedule was not permitting any of the other time slots.  While it was great to learn from Jackie, working with someone who is at the same knowledge level as you, trying to figure things out, is almost even more rewarding.  </br></br>

        I had done my first peer pairing earlier in the week, but wasn't coming into the exercise blind like I was for gps 1.2. I was very worried that I wouldn't know how to do what was being asked of us, that I wouldn't understand the solution or the code that would get us to the solution.  My fears were smothered right away however.  I paired up with Danny from San Fran, and Johnathon was guiding us.  Danny is awesome, totally explained things to me that I wasn't 100% on and Johnathon would jump in as soon as he thought we needed a budge one way or another.</br></br>

        As for feedback, I haven't received any yet, but I also didn't have my settings set up right on my github account, so hopefully that will be rectified soon.  Writing feedback is tough!  I hate to critisize people, good or bad.  And while I understand the importance of sharing the insight with my fellow student, its still hard for me to pick at what they are doing and not feel like I am being overly critical and am doing something wrong.  I just hope my suggestions do some good for someone.  Sharing my thoughts like this to someone else really makes vunerable, it's not something I do on a regular basis. I tend to run error tests in my head over and over again before I even start to be critical towards someone, and now I am being asked to do it regularly!  This will take some time to get used to... </p>
