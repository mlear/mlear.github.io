    	<h2><center>Conflicting Conflicts</center></h2>

    	<p class = "blog_body">Conflict is inevitable.  I would be absolutely shocked if anyone could go a day without experiencing it.  As I type this my daughter is getting progressively louder and louder with her whine because she can't get the cover off the cracker container.  Even 2 year olds have conflicts!  On top of that conflict, she had another conflict, how in the heck was she going to get that open without the help of her father who didn't want her to eat them?  What a terrible daddy!  I'm going to whine some more, maybe that will work!  </br></br>

      Dealing with conflict is what living in a society is all about.  You are going to get your way rarely often.  There is always going to be someone who irks you, wants to argue with you, disrespects you, etc.  It's your reaction to these conflicts that matter.  Can you diffuse the situation?  Can you make the other person see your way?  Can you understand how they are acting and why?  Maybe you are the one who is causing the underlying problem.  Being empathetic is key.  Strong emotional response is almost never the right way to approach things.  Now, if you excuse me, I gotta go deal with the toddler.</br></br></p>

      <h2><center><em>20 Minutes Later</em></center></h2>

      <p class = "blog_body">My litte one is now happily napping with a belly full of Mac and Cheese.  Delicious!  So what happened?  Before I started working on this blog post, I had started boiling water for the kiddo's feed time.  While I was out of the kitchen, the youngest of the three, Mo, found a snack container of crackers.  She wanted to eat those crackers.  She was hungery, Daddy was typing on his computer, and she wanted nothing of it.  So, she whined.  When I didn't respond, and yes she does know how to talk, she whined again, but this time a little louder.  This escalated quite a bit as we (the parents) are trying to ignore her whenever she doesn't communicate in words.  I lost that battle today, but the war lives on!  I didn't want her to eat those crackers, because then she wouldn't eat her lunch, which I had already started cooking.  I patiently explained this to her, and then took the contanier of crackers out of her grabby little paws, placing it on top of the fridge where it would be safe.  Mo was not pleased.  I explained again that it was lunch time, she just had to be patient.  Mo's displeasure continued.  That is why I waited to come back to this until AFTER they were done eating.  I could have yelled at her to shut it,  I could have put her to bed without lunch, I could have screamed at her from the other room, or I could have just continued to ignore her.  I may have even done one of those the first time around with our oldest.  But now, I have learned a bit or two about dealing with two year olds.  They want attention, they love food, and they like to nap.  Not always in that order, but it worked today! </p>
