    		<h2><center>JavaScript For The Win!</center></h2>

    		<p class = "blog_body">I could sit here and write paragraph after paragraph about the history of JavaScript, Netscape, Mozilla, AJAX, Dynamic HTML, and more and more and more...  but I won't!  This blog entry is focused purely on why JavaScript is so popular.  First, JavaScript is supported on virtually all major browsers and does not require a plugin, like flash or silverlight does/did.  Having one language to rule them all works quite nicely for developers, especially when that language is native and has the ability to directly control HTML and CSS.  JavaScript has a huge open source support group that is constantly designing new libraries to make JavaScript easier to control and use for programmers.  </br></br>

  			JavaScript also allows for communication asynchronously.  It allows for "stuff" to happen in the background of your site without forcing you to reset the entire page or slowing down other processes that are also occurring.  Not only does this ridiculously speed up browsing for the user, but boosts performance server side as well.  </br></br>

  			JavaScript is a prototyping language, which means that instead of building out seperate classes, objects can be defined wherever and whenever needed, which allows for unusual structuring and very fast development.  </br></br>

  			Lets also not forgot about the ability to manipulate and update the code realtime! And last, but certainly not least, node.js!</p>
