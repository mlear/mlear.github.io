      <h2><center>Post DBC Life</center></h2>

      <p class = "blog_body">Ok, back to real life once again.  I feel like I have been living in bizarro word for the past 11 weeks.  I didn't blog during DBC because I wanted to focus solely on the work that they were giving me to do.  One thing that I was told prior to starting, and that I firmly believe now, DBC teaches you as little or as much as you want.  But I'll get back to that <br><br>

      Attending DBC was an experience that differed from anything else I had ever done.  The energy and atmosphere is amazing!  Everyone there is extreamly helpful and supportive.  Coming from profession where everyone is only looking out for themselves and won't hesitate to stab you in the back for your job, it was a breath of fresh air.  Even now as the job hunt begins, the whole cohort is still together discussing job oppertunities and contacts that we have made.  It's really weird to be part of this community, and I love every minute of it.  <br><br>

      The pitfall of this type of community though is that you get back what you put in.  You just want to do the base work assigned to you?  That's fine, you'll come out of the program with a basic knowledge of ruby and object oriented programming.  No one is going to yell at you, you're not being graded, there is no competition.  Why would you do that to yourself though?  You signed up for this oppertunity, you signed up to put your life on hold for 9-15 weeks, and you signed up to become a profressional learner.  You have at least 9 weeks of ulimate freedom to learn as much as you can and to make awesome and beautiful things along the way.  TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT.  You will be surronded by brilliant people who have already run into the problems that you run into, and who are specifically there to HELP YOU. <br><br>

      Now, I have to find a job, and as excited as I am to start my new life, I'm really going to miss DBC and everything that happens there.  It truly is an amazing place that all aspiring developers should experience.</p>
