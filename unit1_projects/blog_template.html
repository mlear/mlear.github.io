      <p class = "blog_body">Change is Good.</br></br>

      Change is real good.  So, I'm sitting here looking at my front page and at my blog and think, "Hey now, this isn't so terrible... it just needs a little freshening up, maybe a typo fix here and there, some small redesign..."  Then I did something I had never done before; I opened up my site on my phone.  Whoops.  Ok, so time to make some changes!  Below you can see the progression of this site and how it got to be where it is today. </br></br>

      So here is where it all began.</br></br>

      <p class = "blog_body">And the first redesign.</br></br>

      <center><img class="blogbody" src="http://i61.tinypic.com/2n6uo8i.jpg" alt="updated blog"></center></br></br>

      <p class = "blog_body">So why did I change all that I did?  Well first of all, those huge image links on my front page were not scaling.. at all.  So those needed to be changed, but on top of the scaling issue, the image file sizes were enourmous and taking forever to load, so I decided to scrap them all together and start from scratch with something a little more filesize and mobile friendly.  I really like the way designing is going (ghost for example) so I decided to start down that path.  I then tried to redesign my nav bar to just a static pane up top with the links listed from the right hand side.  Again, in theory on a desktop, this works.  When you scale down though, and many have probably experienced this themselves many times, those tiny little words become impossible to hit with your huge fat thumb!  So I decided to go the button route instead, and after seeing multiple designs, chose to go with the centered icons, as they will scale down nicely to mobile (thanks to Zach Phlederer for that idea!).  </br></br>

      As for the blog page redesign, the fixed background image worked just fine on a full system, but also did not scale well when on a mobile device.  I was also getting really tired of that scroll box.  I wanted something clean and much more simple.  That background image, while being one of my favorite pictures I have ever taken, was way to busy and needed to go.  </br></br>

      Finally, that horrible horrible navigation pane that I had been playing with from the start.  ::shiver::  Time to move on from that as well.  I decided to stick with the new navigation bar that I did for the launchpage and away we went.  Much better. </p>
