		 	<p><center>Welcome to my homepage, my name is Martin Lear and I am part of the June 2, 2014 DBC Cohort!  Above, below, attached and encoded, you will find my work that I am doing to transform my life from a lawyer, to programmer.  You will find here the most basic of exercises, and ultimately my most advanced work.  I will be redesigning this website from time to time as I learn more, so expect changes.</center></p>

 		<h2><center>About Me</center></h2>

 		<div class="about_me">
 			
 			<p>I was born and raised in the Chicagoland area.  I attended Marquette university for my undergraduate studies and quickly came to realize that;</p>

 			</br>I.</br>  Hate.</br> Math.</br></br></br>  Now, this happens to be a problem as I was studying to be a computer engineer, and theortical mathmatics happens to be a part of those studies.  So, I had to reset and start over again.  What I liked about being an engineer was the problem solving aspect.  I like to be given an objective, and to figure out the solution.  I had to find another path that ran along those lines, which led me to pre-law.  NEVER did I consider that little past time I enjoyed at the time, computer programming.  NEVER did I consider that computer programming could lead to a viable career.  NEVER did I consider that being a lawyer was horrible.  We'll get back to that.

 			
 			
 			<p>After graduating from Marquette, I moved with my wife to Steamboat Springs, CO.  Life was glorious in the mountains.  Between the two of us we made more then enough money to survive off of.  During the winter we could ski everyday, and during the summer it was constant mountatin biking and hiking.  I was managing a ski shop out there and the usual day consisted of playing all day in the mountains, and parting with friends at night.  Eventually, however, we grew used to the life style and said to ourselves, "What if?"  So, we decided to start a family.  And for us to have a family, I had to fully particpate in society and become a grown up.  Off to lawschool I went.</p>  

 			<p>Nobody told me to stop and think.  Nobody told me that unless you were in top 3% of your class you would be fighting for jobs.  Nobody told me that I was already making more money in a little mountain town then I would my first year out of law school.  I toughed it out, was blindsided by the job market once I graduated, but eventually found a job and slowly progressed my career.  6 years later and I have hit a wall.  There is no room for progression in my current firm, i'm toxic to other firms as they would have to retrain me but pay me like an experienced attorney, and I found something surprising.  I hate being an attorney.  It's tiring, stressful, thankless work.  The funny thing is, my wife and family all saw how miserable I was, but it took me forever to realize it.  That leads to the now.</p>  

 			<p>I feel like I have rejuevanated myself with the decision to restart my career.  So below, you will find those links I promissed, or will find once they exist!  Please let me know of any critique you may have, I always have open ears and want nothing more to learn and grow as a programmer.</P>
