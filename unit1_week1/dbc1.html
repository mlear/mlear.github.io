    <h1>About Me</h1>
    
      <p>My name is Martin Lear, feel free to call me Marty if you prefer!</br>  I'm 34 and currently living in Glenview, IL with my wife and three kids.</br>
         I'm here at DBC to make a life change that I have been thinking about for years, being a lawyer is not advisable! </p>

    <h2>My Past</h2>
    
      <p>I grew up in the Chicago area and attended <a href="http://www.marquette.edu/">Marquette University</a> for my undergrad.  I began my college life as a Computer Engineer but quickly realized that theortical math and I did not get along well.  I made the mistake of swithcing paths to prelaw instead of continuing with coding, which looking back is what I should have been doing from the start.</p>
      <p>After graduating, I moved to <a href="http://www.steamboat-chamber.com/" target="_blank">Steamboat Springs, CO</a> to take some time off with my girlfriend/soon to be wife and managed a ski shop for a couple of years.  Life is pretty good in the mountains.</p>
      <p>Then, in order to make something of my life beyond endless days of skiing, we moved back to Chicago for me to attend Depaul for law school and begin our family. That brings me to the now!</p>
    
    <h3>Coding</h3>
    
      <p class="yup">I do not have an extensive coding background and am attending DBC in order to try and bring myself back to relevancy.  20 years ago, I was fluent in Basic and C++, but that doesn't help much these days.</p>
    
    <h4>Interests</h4>
    
      <p>I have many interests that include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sports</li>
          <ol>
            <li>Skiing</li>
            <li>Football</li>
            <li>College Basketball</li>
          </ol>
        <li>Video Games</li>
        <li>Microbrews</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h5>My Family</h5>
    
      <p>I have 3 <em>wonderfully</em> <strong>chaotic</strong> children whom you may/will see pop on and off the screen when in goolge hangouts, I apologize in advance!  My wife trys to keep them occupied, but jailbreaks are always emminent.</p>
    
    <h6>The Future</h6>
   
      <p>I hope to use the skills I learn here at DBC To make a new future for myself and family.  Can't wait to work with everyone here!  I also have an alternate email me at, *EDIT that I was going to list here but I have no idea where this page is going to land so I'm using a fake one!* <a href="mailto:m_lear@fakeemail.com">Martin Lear</a> if anyone needs to reach me and cannot.</p>
